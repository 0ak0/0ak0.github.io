                <h4>At a Glance</h4>
                <p>I'm Oaken, a first class Game Design graduate.
                    While knowledgable in programming, my main interest is in environmental and level design for virtual worlds.
                    My work includes not just creating games, but adjusting them and their environments to properly adapt to what the player's needs are, such as in VR and XR applications.
                    I also do simple 2D work, intended for use in texturing, logos, and UI elements.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Environmental Design</h4>
                <p>My work in Environmental Design includes not only creating levels and environments, but also modelling work and lighting.
                    I have experience in creating environments tailored for XR use cases, taking into consideration the needs and requirements of such platforms.
                    Concerning lighting, I use mixtures of diegetic and non-diegetic lights to not only make visible scenes, but capture the player's attention. 
                    I create scenes and environments with the goal of drawing player attention naturally and without the need for overly obvious markers or signals.
                </p>

                <h4>Software Knowledge</h4>
                <p>The software tools I have used and am knowledgable in include:</p>
                <ul class="about-list">
                    <li>Blender</li>

                </ul>
                <p>I have experience in hard surface modelling, environment creation in game engines, lighting in game engines, scripting in game engines, 2D vector design work, and minor video editing work.
                <br><br> I have limited experience with tools such as Godot, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Programming</h4>
                <p><p>I am knowledgable in the following languages:</p>
                <ul class="about-list">
                    <li>Java</li>

                    <li>Basic HTML and CSS</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I am familiar with Object Oriented designs and languages. I have used also Arduino's scripting language and Lua.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Other</h4>
                <p>Many accomplishments and projects I was involved in during my time in Secondary School, Sixth Form, and University share relation to my current interests and work.
                    In Secondary and Sixth Form, I worked on hardware projects including computer peripherals (involving 3D modelling and scripting), helped with the school's Remembrance project (involving 3D modelling and 2D sketch work),
                and was also involved in the backend of my school radio program. I partook in LAMDA and Combined Cadet Force. In LAMDA I studied Public Speaking from grades 3 through 8, earning distinction in all medals.
                In <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> I was promoted to the rank of Sergeant.
                <br> In University I was the main level designer alongside being a modeller and programmer for my final year communal project in creating a game. To this day, we continue working on this game outside of university.
            <br><br>For extra details concerning these experiences, please contact me!</p>
